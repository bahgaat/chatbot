# Spring AI Chat Bot CLI

AI-powered chatbot with domain-specific knowledge (in this case, about Resume) using Spring AI, Retrieval-Augmented Generation RAG and Conversational Memory.

## Key Features
- RAG Implementation: The application uses a vector store to implement RAG, allowing the chatbot to retrieve relevant information from the loaded document.
- Conversation Memory: The MessageChatMemoryAdvisor enables the chatbot to remember previous interactions within the conversation.
- PDF Document Processing: The application can read and process PDF documents, making the information available to the chatbot.
- Interactive Console Interface: The application provides a simple console-based interface for interacting with the chatbot.
